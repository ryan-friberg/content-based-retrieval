# Content-Based Image Retrieval

This is the repository for the final project submission of COMS4995: Deep Learning for Computer Vision of Ryan Friberg and Leah Uzzan. The goal of this code base it to create a deep learning pipeline for image search that can extract feature information from images and select images that are similar in visual features instead of any associated metadata.
